                Welcome to my page! My name is Matt, and I'm an amateur developer. I graduated with a BS in physics
                from Appalchian State University, but started coding in my free time my senior year. I absolutely loved it. To date, I've developed a couple of personal
                projects, ranging from Reddit bots and API scrapers to this website you're looking at now. Check out the projects section below for samples of some of my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy studying music theory, playing the guitar and learning saxophone, as well as getting active outdoors, mostly through running. If you have any
                interest in checking out my music, a link to my soundcloud can be found in the contact section at the bottom of the page.
